# ECE188 Project 2

Project 2 for the ECE188 course Spring 22.

This project has two parts:

- Training an MNIST network.
- Producing and exploring adversarial examples in Neural Nets.

The Colab notebooks has all the information required for the project.

# Running the Colab

While Task 1 can be run directly, here are instructions for running Task 2 and
3:

1. Add the images in the `images` directory to your Google Drive. The images are
   taken directly from the Imagenet database.
2. Update the path for your images in Google Drive before running the code

Note: Task 3 may take as long as 5 to 10 minutes to run. This is due to the
intensive computations involved in the adversarial attack.

**Submission**:

- All your code, tables and text need to be contained in the jupyter notebooks.
  Hence, your final submission would contain 2 notebooks, one for each part.

- Also upload the two notebooks to a public github repo and attack the link of
  the github repo at the top of one of your notebooks.

**DUE DATA** : 10th June 2022
